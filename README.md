# Random Graphs Generator (Erdős–Rényi Model)

## Project Structure

### `main.cpp`
A C++ implementation of a random graph generator based on the Erdős–Rényi model.  
Generates graphs with specified parameters:
- Number of vertices (n)
- Edge probability (p)

### `experiments.py`
Contains experimental results and visualizations analyzing:
1. Graph properties vs. edge probability (p)
2. Graph properties vs. number of vertices (n)

## Key Features
- Efficient generation of G(n,p) model graphs
- Statistical analysis of random graph properties
- Visualization of phase transitions
- Empirical verification of theoretical thresholds
